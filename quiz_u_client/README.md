# quiz_u_client

This is a project submission to [Okoul QuizU Challenge](android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xmlhttps://www.okoul.com/challenges/QuizU), where participants have to develop a Flutter mobile app where users answer the maximum number of questions within 2 minutes

### Design Goals

I tried to keep it as minimal as I can. Using Material Theme with the default blue color. Although I added some sound effects when playing the quiz for greater feedback.
